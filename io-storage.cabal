synopsis:      A key-value store in the IO monad.

description:   This library allows an application to extend the 'global state'
               hidden inside the IO monad with semi-arbitrary data. Data is
               required to be 'Typeable'. The library provides an essentially
               unbounded number of key-value stores indexed by strings, with
               each key within the stores also being a string.
